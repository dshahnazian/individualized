Abstract Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been the subject
of intense debate over the past 2 decades, but its specific
computational function remains controversial. Here we present
a simple computational model of ACC that incorporates
distributed representations across a network of interconnected
processing units. Based on the proposal that ACC is concerned
with the execution of extended, goal-directed action
sequences, we trained a recurrent neural network to predict
each successive step of several sequences associated with
multiple tasks. In keeping with neurophysiological observations
from nonhuman animals, the network yields distributed
patterns of activity across ACC neurons that track the progression
of each sequence, and in keeping with human neuroimaging
data, the network produces discrepancy signals when
any step of the sequence deviates from the predicted step.
These simulations illustrate a novel approach for investigating
ACC function
